## Key Differences and Issues

### 1. Main SDK Class Name
- **Swift**: `NeoSwift.swift`
- **C++**: `neo_cpp.cpp` (CORRECTED - was missing)
- **Status**: ✅ Created NeoCpp class equivalent to NeoSwift

### 2. Reactive Programming
- Swift has RX support (Combine framework)
- C++ version does not have reactive extensions
- This is acceptable for initial implementation

### 3. Contract Interaction
- Swift has comprehensive contract abstraction
- C++ only has basic RPC invocation
- Missing high-level contract interfaces

### 4. Builder Patterns
- Swift has TransactionBuilder
- C++ uses direct Transaction construction
- Should implement builder pattern for consistency

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Core Functionality
1. ✅ Create NeoCpp main class (COMPLETED)
2. Implement TransactionBuilder for easier transaction creation
3. Add ContractParametersContext for multi-sig support

### Priority 2: Contract Support
1. Implement basic SmartContract class
2. Add NeoToken and GasToken native contracts
3. Implement Token interfaces (NEP-17, NEP-11)

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
1. Add NefFile support for contract deployment
2. Implement ContractManagement for contract operations
3. Add event and notification handling

### Priority 4: Nice-to-Have
1. Reactive extensions (optional)
2. Express API for simplified operations
3. Additional utility contracts (NNS, Policy, etc.)

## Consistency Check

### ✅ Verified Consistent
- Crypto operations match Swift implementation
- Serialization format is identical
- Address generation is compatible
- Transaction hashing matches
- RPC method signatures align

### ⚠️ Needs Verification
- Contract invocation parameter encoding
- Multi-sig transaction signing flow
- NEP-6 wallet format compatibility

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests: 30 test files, 692 assertions passing
- All core functionality tested
- Missing tests for contracts and advanced features

## Conclusion

The C++ SDK has successfully implemented the core functionality needed for:
- Key management and cryptography
- Transaction creation and signing
- Basic RPC communication
- Wallet operations

However, it lacks the higher-level abstractions for:
- Smart contract interaction
- Token management
- Advanced transaction building

The SDK is functional for basic operations but needs additional work to match the Swift SDK's full feature set.
