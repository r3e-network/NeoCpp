## Remaining Gaps

### Protocol Layer (High Priority)
- Request/Response tests need expansion
- RPC communication mocking required
- Network protocol validation

### Missing Test Files from Swift
1. Bip32ECKeyPair (HD wallet support)
2. NeoNameService (complete implementation needed)
3. RIPEMD160 (hash algorithm)
4. Mock utilities for testing

## Test Execution

### Running All Tests
```bash
cd build
make test
./run_tests
```

### Running Specific Test Suites
```bash
./run_tests [crypto]     # Crypto tests only
./run_tests [script]     # Script tests only
./run_tests [transaction] # Transaction tests only
./run_tests [contract]   # Contract tests only
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Status
- ‚úÖ Build passes
- ‚úÖ All tests execute
- ‚úÖ No memory leaks (valgrind)
- ‚úÖ Code coverage reported

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Protocol Tests**: Add Request/Response test coverage
2. **Add Mock Infrastructure**: Create mock RPC client for testing
3. **Implement HD Wallet Tests**: Add Bip32 support

### Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Benchmarks**: Add timing tests
2. **Stress Tests**: High-volume transaction testing
3. **Security Tests**: Fuzzing and penetration testing
4. **Documentation Tests**: Ensure all examples work

## Compliance

### Neo Standards
- ‚úÖ NEP-2 (Passphrase-protected private key)
- ‚úÖ NEP-6 (Wallet Standard)
- ‚úÖ NEP-17 (Token Standard)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è NEP-11 (NFT Standard) - Partial

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ No compiler warnings
- ‚úÖ RAII compliance
- ‚úÖ Exception safety
- ‚úÖ Thread safety where required

## Conclusion

The Neo C++ SDK test suite has achieved substantial coverage with comprehensive test implementations matching the Swift SDK. All placeholder tests have been replaced with functional tests, and critical components have excellent coverage.

### Strengths
- Comprehensive crypto and script testing
- Strong transaction building tests
- Good wallet implementation coverage
- Excellent type safety testing

### Areas for Improvement
- Protocol layer needs more coverage
- Mock infrastructure would improve testability
- Some advanced features need test implementation

### Overall Assessment
**Test Coverage Grade: B+**

The test suite is production-ready for most use cases, with particular strength in core functionality. Continued investment in protocol testing and mock infrastructure will bring the suite to A-grade coverage.
